## Welcome to Geriatric Surveillance System
***

Geriatric Surveillance System (GSS) is a system that allows elderly people living alone to be monitored by their loved ones with the help of the sensor. Therefore, the project consists of three phases. These phases are hardware design, backend  and fronted implementation.

In Hardware Design, Arduino and NodeMCU are used to perform receiving signal from home.

Backend Implementation is handled with NodeJS. Also, Rest API is created and related documenation is found in API Documentation Page. ([Click ](https://github.com/mrtkprc/gss-backend/wiki/API-Documentation)to view API Documentation)

Note: This project is graduation project of Istanbul Technical University,Computer Engineering.
